# IT-Help-Desk

This application allows users to create, update, view, resolve and assign tickets. I utilized Java and PostgreSQL for backend to store user and ticket information; and JavaFX to create the UI. The application has Admin, I.T., & Staff users and limits various actions depending on type of user.


All members will need to login.

## Staff Member  

Staff members are only allowed to create tickets and view/update the tickets they have created. All members are able to do this basic functionality. The video below shows how the application runs for staff members.
